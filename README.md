# population_genetics
In a hypothetical population, there is a gene amongst all individuals that is fixed, or that it is the only allele present. Suddenly, there is a new mutation that occurs bringing the allele count to two. Having this mutated genome slightly increases the organism's chance of survival.
In this project, I simulate the evolution of the frequencies of the two alleles within the population and explored the effects of differing levels of fitness for the two alleles as well as the effects of different population sizes.

I set up a population of alleles, assigned fitnesses for them, and had each individual reproduce to make a new generation, which would be biased by their respective fitnesses. Furthermore, I ran the simulation until one of the alleles is extinct and other other is fixed, or has become the only allele in the population. I repeated this process many times to determine the fraction of times the mutant allele becomes fixed.

The wild-type allele is desginated by 0 and the mutant by 1. No further mutations are assumed to occur in this simulation.
